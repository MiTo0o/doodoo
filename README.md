Don't like using .pop(0) because it looks weird? .pop(0) feels weird to
type out for a queue?

LOOK NO FURTHER

The doodoo package contains a poop() function which does the same thing as
.pop(0). BUTTTTTTT since your digestive system is basically a queue (First
In First Out) it only makes sense to use poop(queue) instead of queue.pop(0)
